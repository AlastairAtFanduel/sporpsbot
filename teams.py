Teams

Need to record
x def vs y off how many goes does y off get before score   (idicator that team is outmatched)
x def vs y off how many goes does y off get before turnover/4th down (reverse)

How many attack sequence did they get.  Like above but not effected by turn overs.
Turnovers give points to def and their attack they get a new attack sequence.
Calculate number of ecpected attack sequences per team.

Player results per attack sequence.

Need to predict
x def vs y off how many td do they give up. (turnovers)
x spec vs y spec how many points do they give up
y off vs x def (passing yards, running yards etc)
